# Book Manager API

### RESTful API for a library service completed as a coding test

This modest API [endpoint](https://ekohe-book-manager.herokuapp.com/api/v1/) allows you to:

- Create users with a starting balance and optional name attributes.
- Create loans on books for a specified user and book, if there is enough balance in your user's account.
- Return loans on books (which earns money for the book), if they are currently outstanding.
- See the income generated by a book over a time period.

To get started, see the API docs created with Postman [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6788317/SWLk2k42).
